Obsidian: 
1) A CLI web scraping tool that lets the user view a cryptocurrency of interest.
The user can select between viewing the cryptocurrency through its webpage or through the 
CLI.

2) A secondary function is to allow the user to use an interest calculator between 2
modes: Discrete and Continuous.

***Run main.py as the main application.*** 

Things I would like to improve or add:
1. Allow user to view cryptocurrency of interest through CLI. Update: Done 8/23/17
2. Perhaps a graph that draws the fluctuation of the prices. 
3. More things I cannot think of at the moment.

3rd party software used:
BeautifulSoup
Requests
